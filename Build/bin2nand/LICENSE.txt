License Grant and Use Restrictions.

a.	License Grant.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, TI hereby grants to you under all TI intellectual property rights embodied in the Licensed Materials a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, non-sublicensable license only to (i) use the Licensed Materials solely for the purposes of evaluating, testing, debugging and optimizing applications that execute solely and exclusively on processing devices manufactured by or for TI (“TI Devices”), and (ii) make a reasonable number of copies necessary to exercise the right granted to you in Section 1(a)(i) above. Use of any software applications optimized or developed using the Licensed Materials on processing devices manufactured by or for an entity other than TI is a material breach of this Agreement.  It is also a material breach of this license to use the Licensed Materials to assist in the design, development or verification of a device that is instruction set compatible with, or functionally equivalent to, a TI processing device.

b.	No Distribution License.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT CONVEY ANY LICENSE TO DISTRIBUTE THE LICENSED MATERIALS TO ANY THIRD PARTY.  YOU ARE REQUIRED TO EXECUTE A SEPARATE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH TI BEFORE DISTRIBUTING THE LICENSED MATERIALS OR ANY PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN THE LICENSED MATERIALS, OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF. 

	c.	Limited License to TI and Covenant not to Sue.  Continuing for the term of this Agreement, you hereby grant to TI under any of your patents embodied in the Licensed Materials a non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-assignable, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, export and otherwise distribute such Licensed Materials.  You covenant not to sue or otherwise assert Derived Patents against TI and TI’s affiliates and their licensees of the Licensed Materials.  In the event you assign a Derived Patent, you shall require as a condition of any such assignment that the assignee agree to be bound by the provisions in this Section 1(c) with respect to such Derived Patent.  Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 1(c) shall be null and void.  For purposes of this Agreement, “Derived Patents” means any of your patents issuing from a patent application that discloses and claims an invention conceived of by you after delivery of the Licensed Materials, and derived by you from your access to the Licensed Materials. 

	d.	No Other License.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a license to any intellectual property rights of TI other than those rights embodied in the Licensed Materials provided to you by TI.

Use of the Licensed Materials to assist in the design, development or verification of a device not manufactured by or for TI is a material breach of this Agreement.  Use of the Licensed Materials to evaluate, test, debug and optimize applications for use with processing devices other than those manufactured by or for TI is a material breach of this Agreement.  

iii.	Other than as expressly set forth in this Section 1(e)(iii) and in Section 1(a) above, you may not otherwise copy or reproduce the Licensed Materials.

iv.	You will not sublicense, transfer or assign the Licensed Materials or your rights under this Agreement to any third party.  

v.	You may use the Licensed Materials with Open Source Software (as defined below) or with software developed using Open Source Software (e.g. tools) provided you do not incorporate, combine or distribute the Licensed Materials in a manner that subjects the Licensed Materials, or any derivatives thereof, to any license obligations or any other intellectual property related terms of such Open Source Software.  "Open Source Software" means any software licensed under terms requiring that (A) other software (“Proprietary Software”) incorporated, combined or distributed with such software or developed using such software: (i) be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or (ii) otherwise be licensed on terms inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to permitting use of the Proprietary Software on or with devices other than TI Devices, or (B) the owner of Proprietary Software license any of its patents to users of the Open Source Software and/or Proprietary Software incorporated, combined or distributed with such Open Source Software or developed using such Open Source Software. 

	f.	Termination.  This Agreement is effective until terminated.  You may terminate this Agreement at any time by written notice to TI.  Without prejudice to any other rights, if you fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement, TI may terminate your right to use the Licensed Materials, or any derivative thereof, and any applications generated using the Licensed Materials, or any derivative thereof, upon written notice to you.  Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, you will destroy any and all copies of the Licensed Materials, including any derivatives thereof, in your possession, custody or control and provide to TI a written statement signed by your authorized representative certifying such destruction.

	a.	The Licensed Materials contain copyrighted material, trade secrets and other proprietary information of TI and its licensors and are protected by copyright laws, international copyright treaties and trade secret laws, as well as other intellectual property laws.  To protect TI’s and its licensors’ rights in the Licensed Materials, you agree, except as specifically permitted by statute by a provision that cannot be waived by contract, not to “unlock”, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise translate any portions of the Licensed Materials provided to you in object code format only to a human-perceivable form nor to permit any person or entity to do so.

You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not convey a license to any such third party patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights and that you are solely responsible for any patent, copyright or other intellectual property right claim that relates to your use or distribution of the Licensed Materials, or your use or distribution of your products that include or incorporate the Licensed Materials.  Moreover, you acknowledge that any fees or royalties paid to TI pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable, do not include any fees or royalties that may be payable to any third party based on such third party’s interests in the Licensed Materials or any intellectual property rights that cover implementation of any industry recognized standard, any software program published by any industry recognized standards bodies or any other proprietary technology.

At TI's request, and within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice, you shall permit an independent auditor selected by TI to have access, no more than once each calendar year (unless the immediately preceding audit revealed a breach of this Agreement) and during your regular business hours, to all of your equipment, records and documents as may contain information bearing upon the use of the Licensed Materials.  You shall keep full, complete, clear and accurate records with respect to product sales and distributions for a period beginning with the then-current calendar year and going back three (3) years.

You agree to obtain executed confidentiality agreements with your employees and contractors having access to the Licensed Materials, or any derivative thereof, and to diligently take steps to enforce such agreements in this respect.  TI agrees that industry standard employment agreements used in the normal course of your business shall satisfy the requirements of this section. TI may disclose your contact information to TI’s applicable licensors. 

6.	Warranties and Limitations.  THE LICENSED MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”.  TI MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, REGARDING THE LICENSED MATERIALS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.  YOU AGREE TO USE YOUR INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT IN DEVELOPING YOUR PRODUCTS AND DERIVATIVES OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS.

7.	Indemnification Disclaimer.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT TI AND ITS APPLICABLE LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR AND SHALL NOT DEFEND OR INDEMNIFY YOU AGAINST ANY THIRD PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIM THAT RELATES TO OR IS BASED ON YOUR MANUFACTURE, USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS, OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, OR YOUR MANUFACTURE, USE, OFFER FOR SALE, SALE, IMPORTATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE OR INCORPORATE THE LICENSED MATERIALS, OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF.
